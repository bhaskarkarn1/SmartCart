The order_data file is missing from the data folder due to it's big size so it has to be uploaded separately in the drive to run the final ipynb file.

The well-documented code is in the final.ipynb file. After downloading it, open it in any code editor. Also download the data folder (it should contain all 4 datasets) and the venv folder. With these in place, the code will run smoothly.
